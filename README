WHAT IS EWRL?

    Ewrl (pronounced: "URL") is a python module designed to expand urls,
    collect titles, and generate short urls, while also having the ability
    to log how many times a given url has been "seen", and via what sources.

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Expands short URLS to their logner counterparts

 * Determine the title of a given url.

 * Clean crazy nonsense urls
 

NOTES

	This is by no means production-ready code. Do not actually use it in
	production unless you wish to be eaten by a grue.
